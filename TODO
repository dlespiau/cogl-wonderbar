== Smaller

* Compute the gl_NormalMatrix ourselves
* Port the mash code to the new AttributesBuffer API
* cogl: cogl_quaternion_init_from_euler() is not documented
* cogl: cogl_quaternion_init_from_quaternion() to avoid the allocation
* cogl: could cogl_quaternion_multiply() multiply in place?

== Bigger

* camera component, setup the scene and paint sequence with it
* add quaternion interpolation to animation-clip
* point light
* cast shadows (soft?)
* SSAO

== Write about the learnings

* lighting (phong)
* "smooth" vertices
* entity/components system
* quaternions
